    Frankenstein's Roomba is a new robot in development. It will compete in Dragon Con Robot Battles 2025. The goal is to be a final iteration on several design concepts we've employed
    successfully in the past, including suction fans and our customized high-torque drivetrain. It doesn't have an active weapon, but is capable of forcing other robots
    on top of it
